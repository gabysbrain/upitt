> gen_model.sh # This will generate classifier.model from data in data/
> run_model.sh <test.arff> # Test test.arff on the classifier

=== Notes on file locations ===
combine_data.sh, gen_model.sh, run_model.sh, and compute_header.sh all depend
on census.txt, NewYork.train, and Ohio.train on being in a data/ directory.

=== Scripts ===
* gen_model.sh: Generate classifier.model from all the training data in data/
* run_model.sh: Take a file as an argument and test it on classifier.model
* agg_data.sh: Aggregate the results from all the folds
* classify.sh: Given a test and train arff file run all 3 classifiers and 
               write out the confusion matrix
* classify_all.sh: For each fold under eval/ run classify.sh
* combine_data.sh: Combine the .train files and the census file
* compute_header.sh: compute the header which is an aggregate from the census
                     file and the state files
* compute_results.py: python script that calculates accuracy, precision, 
                      recall, and f score from a 2x2 confusion matrix
* create_folds.sh: Recreate the eval/ directory and a directory for each
                   of the k trials in k-fold validation
* csv2arff.py: Converts a csv file to arff
* hard_select_attrs.sh: cuts the 5 most important attributes out of a csv file
* run_expr.sh: Runs a k-fold validation experiment
* select_attrs.sh: Calls weka's Chi^2 evaluator on an arff file to filter
                   out a certain number of attributes
