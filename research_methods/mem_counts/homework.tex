{\bf Research Methods Homework} \hfill {\raggedleft Thomas Torsney-Weir}

I used the cachegrind tool from valgrind to compute the number of memory
references in my quicksort program.  It performs a cache simulation but 
it also returns the number of data memory accesses.  I ran the program
five times and every time the number of memory accesses was 117,656.  This
number includes memory used for printing the result to the screen, 
initializing the array, and any other operations c programs do before and 
after the main program in addition to the number of accesses for the quicksort
function itself.
