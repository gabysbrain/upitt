For matching the heads of roles, very few words had useful common ancestors 
on word net.  Many themes are proper nouns which don't show up in word net.  
With the exception of the theme of sense 2 of bet these all have a common 
ancestor near the top of the hypernym tree.  This wouldn't be very helpful 
for selectional restrictions.  Selecting on the phrase type seems like a much 
better option.
